# EduAlign React Frontend

React (Vite + TypeScript) SPA for **EduAlign — AI Powered College Matcher**: a multi-step experience-first college match flow, dashboards, reviews, financial planning, and compare tools — all talking to the FastAPI backend.

## Features

- **Find Your Match** — Sliders for 8 experience dimensions → POST `/api/match` → top 4 matches with radar charts (Plotly.js)
- **Financial Planner** — College selector, in-state/on-campus toggles, degree length, budget/savings → graduation plan, cost bar chart, alternatives table, budget tracker
- **Compare Colleges** — Multi-select 2–4 colleges → experience radar comparison + financial grouped bar chart + key metrics

Charts use **react-plotly.js** (Plotly.js under the hood), matching the former Python Plotly behavior.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run (dev)

With the FastAPI backend running on port 8000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/`. Serve with any static host or point your backend at `dist/index.html` for production.

## Logo

Place your main EduAlign logo (e.g. graduation cap + “EduAlign” text) at **`frontend/public/logo.png`**. It is used in the sidebar, login page, signup page, and forgot-password page. Use a transparent or light-colored version if the logo will appear on the dark sidebar.
